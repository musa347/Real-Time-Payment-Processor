ISO 20022 Real-Time Payment Processor (Java 23)
 Problem Statement
The global payment industry is rapidly moving from legacy SWIFT MT messages to ISO 20022 XML-based messages, which provide richer and more structured payment data.

Financial institutions, fintechs, and payment processors need to handle:
Ingestion of ISO 20022 messages (e.g., pacs.008, pacs.002, camt.053).
Validation & transformation into internal formats.
Real-time processing with low latency and high reliability.
Regulatory compliance and secure settlement.
Scalability for peak transaction volumes.

This project demonstrates a Java 23-powered backend system for processing ISO 20022 payments in real-time, showcasing modern backend engineering principles.

 Objectives
Build a scalable Java 23 backend that supports ISO 20022 payment flows.
Use Spring Boot 3.3+, Reactive Streams, and Virtual Threads (Project Loom) for concurrency.
Implement message ingestion, validation, and processing pipelines.
Provide audit logging, error handling, and reporting APIs.
Deploy via Docker & Kubernetes for cloud-native operation.

Components
API Gateway → Exposes REST/GraphQL endpoints for payment initiation.
Message Parser & Validator → Parses ISO 20022 XML, validates against schemas (.xsd).
Payment Orchestrator → Routes messages, applies business rules.
Fraud Detection Engine → Real-time anomaly detection using rule-based + ML.
Ledger Service → Double-entry accounting system for balance updates.
Settlement Service → Handles clearing & settlement flows.
Response Generator → Generates ISO 20022 compliant acknowledgments.
Reporting API → Exposes transaction data for compliance & monitoring.
 Implementation Process
1. Tech Stack
Java 23 (Virtual Threads, Pattern Matching, Sequenced Collections)
Spring Boot 3.3+ (WebFlux, Reactive Data)
PostgreSQL (transaction storage, ISO message persistence)
Kafka (event-driven architecture, payment streaming)
Redis (caching, idempotency checks)
Docker & Kubernetes (containerization & deployment)
2. ISO 20022 Message Handling
Inbound:
Accept pacs.008 (FI to FI Customer Credit Transfer).
Outbound:
Respond with pacs.002 (FI to FI Payment Status Report).
Additional:
Support camt.053 for statements & reconciliation.
3. Concurrency with Java 23
Use Virtual Threads to handle thousands of concurrent payments efficiently:
try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    List<Callable<String>> tasks = payments.stream()
        .map(payment -> (Callable<String>) () -> processPayment(payment))
        .toList();

    var results = executor.invokeAll(tasks);
}
4. Validation Pipeline
Schema validation with ISO 20022 XSDs.
Business rule validation:
Check account balances.
Validate participant institutions.
Ensure idempotency.
5. Deployment
Dockerfile for containerization.
docker-compose.yml for local setup (Postgres + Kafka + Redis).
Kubernetes manifests for scaling in cloud environments.
 Quick Start
Clone the Repo
git clone the repository
cd iso20022-processor
Run with Docker
docker-compose up --build
Sample API Call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/xml" \
  -d @sample_pacs008.xml
 Future Enhancements
Add ISO 20022 → JSON mapping for APIs.
Integrate with blockchain settlement rails.
Plug in ML-based fraud detection.
Support multi-currency & FX payments.

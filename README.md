ISO 20022 Real-Time Payment Processor (Java 23)
Problem Statement

The global payment industry is rapidly moving from legacy SWIFT MT messages to ISO 20022 XML-based messages, which provide richer and more structured payment data.

Financial institutions, fintechs, and payment processors need to handle:

Ingestion of ISO 20022 messages (e.g., pacs.008, pacs.002, camt.053).

Validation & transformation into internal formats.

Real-time processing with low latency and high reliability.

Regulatory compliance and secure settlement.

Scalability for peak transaction volumes.

This project demonstrates a Java 23-powered backend system for processing ISO 20022 payments in real-time, showcasing modern backend engineering principles.

Objectives

Build a scalable Java 23 backend that supports ISO 20022 payment flows.

Use Spring Boot 3.3+, Reactive Streams, and Virtual Threads (Project Loom) for concurrency.

Implement message ingestion, validation, and processing pipelines.

Provide audit logging, error handling, and reporting APIs.

Deploy via Docker & Kubernetes for cloud-native operation.

Implementation Process
Tech Stack

Java 23: Virtual Threads, Pattern Matching, Sequenced Collections

Spring Boot 3.3+: WebFlux, Reactive Data

PostgreSQL: Transaction storage, ISO message persistence

Kafka: Event-driven architecture, payment streaming

Redis: Caching, idempotency checks

Docker & Kubernetes: Containerization & deployment

ISO 20022 Message Handling

Inbound: Accept pacs.008 (FI to FI Customer Credit Transfer).

Outbound: Respond with pacs.002 (FI to FI Payment Status Report).

Additional: Support camt.053 for statements and reconciliation.

Concurrency with Java 23

Use Virtual Threads to handle thousands of concurrent payments efficiently:

try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    List<Callable> tasks = payments.stream()
        .map(payment -> (Callable) () -> processPayment(payment))
        .toList();
    var results = executor.invokeAll(tasks);
}

Validation Pipeline

Schema validation with ISO 20022 XSDs.

Business rule validation:

Check account balances.

Validate participant institutions.

Ensure idempotency.

Deployment

Dockerfile for containerization.

docker-compose.yml for local setup (Postgres, Kafka, Redis).

Kubernetes manifests for scaling in cloud environments.

Quick Start

Clone the Repo:

git clone [https://github.com/your-repo/iso20022-processor.git](https://github.com/musa347/Real-Time-Payment-Processor)
cd iso20022-processor


Run with Docker:

docker-compose up --build


Sample API Call:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/payments \
-H "Content-Type: application/xml" \
-d @sample_pacs008.xml

Future Enhancements

Add ISO 20022 â†’ JSON mapping for APIs.

Integrate with blockchain settlement rails.

Plug in ML-based fraud detection.

Support multi-currency & FX payments.
